#Details about groovy support in jo-bridge.

# Introduction #

The jo-bridge architecture can support "easily" any Java-based (or better, jar based) intepreter.

To test this capability, I developed a Groovy bridge implementation.

Why Groovy? Because it is a simple scripting language, it is syntactically similar to Java, and it has a great documentation.
Last but not least, it's yet available a [section](http://groovy.codehaus.org/OSGi+and+Groovy) about OSGi and Groovy integration.
